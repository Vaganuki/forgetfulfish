I'm currently in training but really enjoy Magic: The gathering and trying new grounds.

You can discover everything [about this format](https://youtu.be/Otdgj8fBQxc?si=kkpsFRTL9Vxxs4Sy) on [Rhystic Studies' channel](https://www.youtube.com/@RhysticStudies). Both this channel and format became truly dear to me really fast; Thus I hope this project will reach the potential it has in my mind.

Thanks for stopping by and for your support !
